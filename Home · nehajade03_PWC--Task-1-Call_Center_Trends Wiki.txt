*Problem Statement*

  *

    Track Customer Satisfaction – Visualize overall satisfaction levels
    for improvement.

  *

    Analyze Call Efficiency – Monitor calls answered vs. abandoned and
    average speed of answer (ASA).

  *

    Identify Call Volume Trends – Show call patterns by time (hour, day,
    week) for resource optimization.

  *

    Evaluate Agent Performance – Use a quadrant chart (average handle
    time vs. calls answered) to assess agents.

  *

    Enhance Decision-Making – Provide actionable insights via
    interactive visualizations for better service and operations.

*Data source*

Dataset used for this task was presented by PWC and call center trends
dataset:

The Call Center Trends dataset has been transformed and loaded into
Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.

The dataset contains 10 columns and 5,000 rows of observations.

Dataset:

*Data Preparation*

The data cleaning process in Power Query Editor included the following
steps:

  *

    Removed irrelevant columns.

  *

    Eliminated unnecessary rows.

  *

    Verified and ensured correct data types for all columns.

*Data Analysis*

And then dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to the data
modeled.

The dataset includes several new measures for in-depth analysis:

|Total Calls – The total number of calls received.

Total Resolved Calls – The number of calls that were successfully resolved.

Unresolved Calls – The number of calls that remain unresolved.

Average Talk Duration – The average duration of conversations during calls.

Average Satisfaction – The average customer satisfaction score across calls.

Average Speed of Answer – The average time taken to answer calls.
|

These measures are designed to provide detailed insights into call
center performance and agent efficiency.

*Data analysis(DAX)*:

answered call = COUNTX(FILTER('Call Center trends','Call Center
trends'[Answered (Y/N)] = "Y"), 'Call Center trends'[Answered (Y/N)])

Average Satisfaction Rating = AVERAGE('Call Center trends'[Satisfaction
rating])

Average Speed of Answer = AVERAGE('Call Center trends'[Speed of answer
in seconds])

Total Calls = COUNTROWS('Call Center trends')

Total Resolved Calls = COUNTROWS(FILTER('Call Center trends',TRIM('Call
Center trends'[Resolved]) = "Y"))

Unanswered Calls = COUNTROWS(FILTER('Call Center trends',TRIM('Call
Center trends'[Answered (Y/N)]) = "N"))

Unresolved Calls = COUNTROWS(FILTER('Call Center trends', 'Call Center
trends'[Resolved] = "N"))

Data Visualization (Dashboard) :

Data visualization for the data analysis (DAX) was done in Microsoft
Power BI Desktop:

*Insights*

1.The dashboard provides several key insights into the call center trends:

|Total Calls: 5,000 calls were received, with 4,054 calls answered and 946 calls answered by agents.
|

2.Agent Performance:

|Jim resolved the highest number of calls (666), followed by Martha (638) and Dan (633).

Martha also had the fastest response time, with an average speed of answer of 36 seconds, while Stewart had the slowest, at 32 seconds.
|

3.Topic Analysis:

|The highest number of calls were related to Streaming (1.02K calls, 20.44%), followed by Technical Support (0.98K calls, 19.52%).
|

4.Satisfaction Ratings:

|A large number of calls (1,218) were rated with a 3-star satisfaction, while 5-star ratings accounted for 843 calls.
|

5.Daily Call Resolution Trends:

|Call resolution spikes occurred around Day 16, with 143 calls resolved. A general decline is visible towards the end of the month.
